## Reflection <a name="reflection"></a>
This was the hardest project yet. I already had HTML and CSS knowledge coming in to this Bootcamp so the first couple of lessons were pretty familiar. I had studied JavaScript in the past as well and have what I consider the most basic of understandings of it, but have always struggled with it. This was no different. 

I started out by writing out psuedocode to break down what I wanted the script to do. Once I already started rewritting my code though, I think I restarted a minimum of 3 times trying to figure out how to get everything to work. 

I found myself getting really hung up on the fact that I knew the code I was writing wasn't the best code and that while it was working and doing what I wanted it to do, it was just extremely long and clunky. Even searching around and looking at stackoverflow and other forums and seeing people doing similar projects, I was seeing a lot of objects and functions that I couldn't quite wrap my head around. 

In the end I have a working generator that hits all the required assignment criteria, and while I know the code could be better, I'm still proud I was able to write it myself.
